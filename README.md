# PRESENTATION: WebRTC (Realtime Communication): Plugin-free Video Conferencing in the Browser

The promise of plugin-free video conferencing in the browser began almost a decade ago in 2010. It's been a long time coming, but as of late 2017, WebRTC support was finally announced in all major web browsers.

In this talk, Scott Davis (Principal Engineer, ThoughtWorks) walks you through the basics of WebRTC development.

After this presentation, you'll have a solid understand of what it takes to start video conferencing in a standards-based way.
